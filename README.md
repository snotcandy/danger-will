want to run an animation with a few LEDS to remain lit 
I am brand new to coding and had no idea if would be such the feat.
my goal is to lite up my truck with 3 different plexiglass type mounts on the outside 2 on the side of hood and big one up top. 
to run wifi and in conjuction with running litghts and turning signals.
obv my greatest weakness is coding as i am writing this after days of WFT is this????
any help on teaching me this craft would be greatly appericated.
